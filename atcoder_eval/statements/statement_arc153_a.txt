Problem Statement
A positive integer x is said to be a beautiful integer if and only if x is a 9-digit integer whose decimal notation S_1…S_9 (S_i is the i-th character) satisfies all of the following conditions:

S_1 is not 0,
S_1 = S_2,
S_5 = S_6, and
S_7 = S_9.


For instance, 998244353 and 333333333 are beautiful integers, while 111112222 is not, since S_5 ≠S_6.

You are given a positive integer N. Print the N-th smallest beautiful integer.

Constraints
N is a positive integer.
There are at least N beautiful integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N


Output
Print the N-th smallest beautiful integer.
