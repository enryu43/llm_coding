Problem Statement
You are given a sequence of N non-negative integers A=(A_1,A_2,…,A_N) and a positive integer K.
Find the bitwise XOR of ∑_i=1^K A_X_i over all N^K sequences of K positive integer sequences X=(X_1,X_2,…,X_K) such that 1 ≤X_i ≤N (1≤i ≤K).


        What is bitwise XOR?
    

        The bitwise XOR of non-negative integers A and B, A ⊕B, is defined as follows:
        
When A ⊕B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k ≥0) is 1 if exactly one of the digits in that place of A and B is 1, and 0 otherwise.

        For example, we have 3 ⊕5 = 6 (in base two: 011 ⊕101 = 110).  
        Generally, the bitwise XOR of k non-negative integers p_1, p_2, p_3, …, p_k is defined as (…((p_1 ⊕p_2) ⊕p_3) ⊕…⊕p_k). We can prove that this value does not depend on the order of p_1, p_2, p_3, …, p_k.

There are four sequences to consider: (X_1,X_2)=(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2), for which A_X_1+A_X_2 is 20,40,40,60, respectively. Thus, the answer is 20 ⊕40 ⊕40 ⊕60=40.
