Problem Statement
We have an N-sided die where all sides have the same probability to show up. Let us repeat rolling this die until every side has shown up.

For integers i such that 1 ≤i ≤M, find the expected value, modulo 998244353, of the i-th power of the number of times we roll the die.


        Definition of expected value modulo 998244353



        It can be proved that the sought expected values are always rational numbers. Additionally, under the constraints of this problem, when such a value is represented as an irreducible fraction P/Q, it can be proved that Q ≠0 998244353. Thus, there is a unique integer R such that R ×Q = P 998244353 and 0 ≤R < 998244353. Print this R.
    


Constraints
1 ≤N,M ≤2 ×10^5
All values in the input are integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N M


Output
Print M lines.

The i-th line should contain the expected value, modulo 998244353, of the i-th power of the number of times we roll the die.
