Problem Statement
You are given a simple undirected graph with N vertices numbered 1 to N and M edges numbered 1 to M. Edge i connects vertex u_i and vertex v_i.

Find the number, modulo 998244353, of ways to write an integer between 1 and K, inclusive, on each vertex of this graph to satisfy the following condition:

two vertices connected by an edge always have different numbers written on them.


Constraints
1 ≤N ≤30
0 ≤M ≤min(30, N(N-1)/2 )
1 ≤K ≤10^9
1 ≤u_i v_i ≤N
The given graph is simple.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N M K
u_1 v_1
u_2 v_2
⋮u_M v_M


Output
Print the number, modulo 998244353, of ways to write integers between 1 and K, inclusive, on the vertices to satisfy the condition.

Sample Output 1
2


Here are the two ways to satisfy the condition.

Write 1 on vertices 1, 3, 4, and write 2 on vertex 2.
Write 1 on vertex 2, and write 2 on vertex 1, 3, 4.


Sample Input 2
4 0 10


Sample Output 2
