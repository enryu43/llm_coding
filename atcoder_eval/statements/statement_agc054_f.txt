Problem Statement
Given is a sequence A of N positive integers and a sequence B of N-1 positive integers.
You can do the following operation any number of times.

Choose integers i and j (1 ≤i < j ≤N) and decrease each of the following values by 1: A_i,A_j,B_i,B_i+1,⋯,B_j-1. Here, there should not be any negative value after this operation.


Let m be the maximum number of operations that can be done.
Find the number, modulo 998244353, of sequences that A can be after m operations.

Constraints
1 ≤N ≤2 ×10^5
1 ≤A_i ≤10^9
1 ≤B_i ≤10^9
All values in input are integers.


Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

We have m=2. After two operations, A will be one of the following three sequences.

A=(1,0,0): we end up with this after operations with (i,j)=(2,3) and (i,j)=(2,3).
A=(0,1,0): we end up with this after operations with (i,j)=(1,3) and (i,j)=(2,3).
A=(0,0,1): we end up with this after operations with (i,j)=(1,2) and (i,j)=(2,3).

Note that we do not distinguish two scenarios with different contents of B if the contents of A are the same.
