Problem Statement
You are given a permutation P=(P_1,P_2,⋯,P_2N) of (1,2,⋯,2N).

The following operation may be performed between 0 and N times (inclusive).

Choose an integer x (1 ≤x ≤2N-1). Swap the values of P_x and P_x+1.


Present a sequence of operations that make P satisfy the following conditions.

P_i<P_i+1 for each i=1,3,5,⋯,2N-1;
P_i>P_i+1 for each i=2,4,6,⋯,2N-2.


It can be proved that such a sequence of operations always exists.

Constraints
1 ≤N ≤10^5
(P_1,P_2,⋯,P_2N) is a permutation of (1,2,⋯,2N).
All values in input are integers.


Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N
P_1 P_2 ⋯P_2N


Output
Print a desired sequence of operations in the following format:

K
x_1 x_2 ⋯x_K 


Here, K is the number of operations performed (0 ≤K ≤N), and x_i is the value of x chosen in the i-th operation (1 ≤x_i ≤2N-1).
If there are multiple solutions satisfying the condition, printing any of them will be accepted.
