Problem Statement
You are given a rooted tree with N vertices.
The vertices are numbered 1 to N, and the root is vertex 1.
The parent of each vertex i except the root is vertex P_i. Each vertex, including the root, has  no child or exactly two children.
Determine whether it is possible to write one of the characters X and Y on each vertex of the given tree to satisfy the following condition.
Condition: For each edge of the tree, consider the string of length 2 obtained by concatenating the characters written on the endpoints in the order from the parent P_i to the child i. Among the (N - 1) strings obtained in this way,

exactly A are XX,
exactly B are XY,
exactly C are YX, and
none is YY.

You have T test cases to solve.

Constraints

T ≥1
N ≥1
For each input, the sum of N over the test cases is at most 10^4.
A ≥0
B ≥0
C ≥0
A + B + C = N - 1
1 ≤P_i < i   (2 ≤i ≤N)
Each vertex k  (1 ≤k ≤N) occurs as a parent P_i  (2 ≤i ≤N) zero times or twice in total.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input
 in the following format:
T
case_1
case_2
⋮case_T

Each test case case_i  (1 ≤i ≤T) is in the following format:
N A B C
P_2 P_3 ⋯P_N


Output
Print T lines.
The i-th line should contain Yes if there is a way to write characters to satisfy the condition, and No otherwise.

Sample Input

7 2 2 2
1 1 2 2 3 3
7 0 2 4
1 1 2 2 3 3
7 2 0 4
1 1 2 2 4 4


Sample Output

 1Yes
Yes
No

For the first test case, if you, for instance, write XXYXYXX in this order on vertices 1 to 7,

from the edge (1, 2), we obtain XX,
from the edge (1, 3), we obtain XY,
from the edge (2, 4), we obtain XX,
from the edge (2, 5), we obtain XY,
from the edge (3, 6), we obtain YX, and
from the edge (3, 7), we obtain YX.

Each of XX, XY, and YX occurs twice, so the condition is satisfied.
For the second case, one way to satisfy the condition is to write XYYXXXX.
For the third case, there is no way to satisfy the condition.
