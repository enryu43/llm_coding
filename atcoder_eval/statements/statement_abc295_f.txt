Problem Statement
You are given a string S consisting of digits and positive integers L and R for each of T test cases. Solve the following problem.
For a positive integer x, let us define f(x) as the number of contiguous substrings of the decimal representation of x (without leading zeros) that equal S.
For instance, if S= 22, we have f(122) = 1, f(123) = 0, f(226) = 1, and f(222) = 2.
Find ∑_k=L^R f(k).

Constraints

1 ≤T ≤1000
S is a string consisting of digits whose length is between 1 and 16, inclusive.
L and R are integers satisfying 1 ≤L ≤R < 10^16.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input
 in the following format, where case_i denotes the i-th test case:
T
case_1
case_2
⋮case_T

Each test case is in the following format:
S L R


Output
Print T lines in total.
The i-th line should contain an integer representing the answer to the i-th test case.

This input contains six test cases.

In the first test case, S= 22, L=23, R=234.
f(122)=f(220)=f(221)=f(223)=f(224)=…=f(229)=1.
f(222)=2.
Thus, the answer is 12.


In the second test case, S= 0295, L=295, R=295.
Note that f(295)=0.
