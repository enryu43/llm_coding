Problem Statement
You will participate in N contests, numbered 1 to N in chronological order.

A participant in each contest will be given a value called performance for that contest. Let P_i be the performance for contest i.

Additionally, you have a value called rating, which changes according to the performances in contests. The initial rating is 0, and the rating after contest n is 1/n (∑_i=1^n P_i ).

However, once your rating is B or higher, later contests will not affect your rating.

Before the contests, you have decided to estimate your performance in each contest. Let a_i be the initial estimate of your performance in contest i. Process Q queries in the order they are given.

In each query, you are given two integers c and x. First, change the estimate of your performance in contest c to x. (This change is persistent.) Then, assuming that you get the estimated performances in all N contests, print your final rating after the contests.

Constraints
1 ≤N ≤5 ×10^5
1 ≤B ≤10^9
1 ≤Q ≤10^5
0 ≤a_i ≤10^9
1 ≤c ≤N
0 ≤x ≤10^9
All values in the input are integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format, where c_i and x_i are the c and x for the i-th query:

N B Q
a_1 a_2 …a_N
c_1 x_1
c_2 x_2
⋮c_Q x_Q


Output
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query.

Your output is considered correct if the absolute or relative error from the true answer is at most 10^-9.

Initially, (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5) = (5, 1, 9, 3, 8).

The first query changes a_4 to 9, making (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5) = (5, 1, 9, 9, 8).

Here, assuming that your performance in contest i is a_i, your rating will change as follows.

Initially, your rating is 0.
After contest 1, your rating will be 5 / 1 = 5.
After contest 2, your rating will be (5 + 1) / 2 = 3.
After contest 3, your rating will be (5 + 1 + 9) / 3 = 5.
After contest 4, your rating will be (5 + 1 + 9 + 9) / 4 = 6.
Your rating will no longer change, because your rating after contest 4 is not less than B.


Thus, your final rating after the contests is 6, which should be printed in the first line.
