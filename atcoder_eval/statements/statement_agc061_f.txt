Problem Statement
There are positive integers N and M.

A binary string s is called good if all of the followings are satisfied:

s is non-empty.
The number of 1s in s is a multiple of N.
The number of 0s in s is a multiple of M.


A good string is called perfect if it doesn't contain shorter good (contiguous) substrings. For example, if N = 3 and M = 2, then strings 111, 00 and 10101 are perfect, but 0000 and 11001 are not.

One can show that for any N, M the number of perfect strings is finite. Find this number modulo 998 244 353.

Constraints
1 ≤N, M ≤40
All values in the input are integers.
