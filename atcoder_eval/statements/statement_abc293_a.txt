Problem Statement
You are given a string S of even length consisting of lowercase English letters.  Let |S| be the length of S, and S_i be the i-th character of S.  
Perform the following operation for each i = 1, 2, â€¦, |S|/2 in this order, and print the final S.  

Swap S_2i-1 and S_2i.


Constraints

S is a string of even length consisting of lowercase English letters.
The length of S is at most 100.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input
 in the following format:
S


Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input

 1abcdef


Sample Output

 1badcfe

Initially, S = abcdef.
Performing the operation for i = 1 swaps S_1 and S_2, making S = bacdef.
Performing the operation for i = 2 swaps S_3 and S_4, making S = badcef.
Performing the operation for i = 3 swaps S_5 and S_6, making S = badcfe.
Thus, badcfe should be printed.
