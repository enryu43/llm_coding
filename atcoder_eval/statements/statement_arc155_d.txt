Problem Statement
For two non-negative integers x and y, let (x,y) be the greatest common divisor of x and y (for x=0, let (x,y)=(y,x)=y).
There are N integers on the blackboard, and the i-th integer is A_i. The greatest common divisor of these N integers is 1.
Takahashi and Aoki will play a game against each other. After initializing an integer G to 0, they will take turns performing the following operation, with Takahashi going first.

Choose a number a on the blackboard such that (G,a)≠1, erase it, and replace G with (G,a).

The first player unable to play loses.
For each i (1≤i ≤N), determine the winner when Takahashi chooses the i-th integer on the blackboard in his first turn, and then both players play optimally.

Constraints

2 ≤N ≤2 ×10^5
2 ≤A_i ≤2 ×10^5
The greatest common divisor of the N integers A_i  (1≤i ≤N) is 1.
All values in the input are integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input
 in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 …A_N


Output
Print N lines. The i-th line should contain the winner's name, Takahashi or Aoki, when Takahashi chooses the i-th integer on the blackboard in his first turn, and then both players play optimally.

Sample Input

 14
2 3 4 6


Sample Output

 1Takahashi

Takahashi
Aoki

For instance, when Takahashi chooses the fourth integer A_4=6 in his first turn, Aoki can then choose the second integer A_2=3 to make G=3. Now, Takahashi cannot choose anything, so Aoki wins. Thus, the fourth line should contain Aoki.

The blackboard may contain the same integer multiple times.
