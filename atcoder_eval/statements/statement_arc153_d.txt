Problem Statement
For a positive integer x, let f(x) denote the sum of its digits. For instance, we have f(153) = 1 + 5 + 3 = 9, f(2023) = 2 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 7, and f(1) = 1.

You are given a sequence of positive integers A = (A_1, …, A_N). Find the minimum possible value of ∑_i=1^N f(A_i + x) where x is a non-negative integer.

Constraints
1≤N≤2×10^5
1≤A_i < 10^9


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N
A_1 …A_N


Output
Print the minimum possible value of ∑_i=1^N f(A_i + x) where x is a non-negative integer.

Sample Input 1
4
4 13 8 6


Sample Output 1
14


For instance, x = 7 makes ∑_i=1^N f(A_i+x) = f(11) + f(20) + f(15) + f(13) = 14.

Sample Input 2
4
123 45 678 90


Sample Output 2
34


For instance, x = 22 makes ∑_i=1^N f(A_i+x) = f(145) + f(67) + f(700) + f(112) = 34.

Sample Input 3
3
1 10 100


Sample Output 3
3


For instance, x = 0 makes ∑_i=1^N f(A_i+x) = f(1) + f(10) + f(100) = 3.

Sample Input 4
1
153153153


Sample Output 4
1


For instance,  x = 9999846846847 makes ∑_i=1^N f(A_i+x) = f(10000000000000) = 1.
