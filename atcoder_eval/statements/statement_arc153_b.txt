Problem Statement
We have a grid with H rows from top to bottom and W columns from left and right. Initially, the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left has a lowercase English letter A_i,j.

Let us perform Q operations on this grid. In the i-th operation, we are given integers a_i and b_i such that 1≤a_i ≤H-1 and 1≤b_i≤W-1, and do the following.

Let R_1, R_2, R_3, and R_4 be rectangular regions within the grid defined as follows:
R_1 is the intersection of the top a_i rows and leftmost b_i columns;
R_2 is the intersection of the top a_i rows and rightmost W-b_i columns;
R_3 is the intersection of the bottom H-a_i rows and leftmost b_i columns;
R_4 is the intersection of the bottom H-a_i rows and rightmost W-b_i columns.


Rotate 180 degrees each of R_1, R_2, R_3, and R_4.


Here, a 180-degree rotation of a rectangular region R within the grid moves the character on the square at the i-th from the top and j-th column from the left in R to the square at the i-th from the bottom and j-th column from the right in R. See also the figures for the samples.

Print the grid after all Q operations.

Constraints
