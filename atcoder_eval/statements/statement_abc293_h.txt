Problem Statement
You are given a tree with N vertices numbered 1 through N.  The i-th edge connects vertex A_i and vertex B_i.  
Find the minimum integer K such that you can paint each vertex in a color so that the following two conditions are satisfied.  You may use any number of colors.

For each color, the set of vertices painted in the color is connected and forms a simple path.
For all simple paths on the tree, there are at most K distinct colors of the vertices in the path.


Constraints

If K=3, the conditions can be satisfied by painting vertices 1,2,3,4, and 5 in color 1, vertex 6 in color 2, and vertex 7 in color 3.
If K ≤2, there is no way to paint the vertices to satisfy the conditions, so the answer is 3.
