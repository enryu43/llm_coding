Problem Statement
You are given a sequence A = (A_1, A_2, …, A_N) of positive integers and a positive integer X.
You can perform the operation below any number of times, possibly zero:

Choose an index i (1≤i≤N) and a non-negative integer x such that 0≤x≤X. Change A_i to 2A_i+x.

Find the smallest possible value of max{A_1,A_2,…,A_N}-min{A_1,A_2,…,A_N} after your operations.

Constraints

2≤N≤10^5
1≤X≤10^9
1≤A_i≤10^9

Let (i, x) denote an operation that changes A_i to 2A_i+x. An optimal sequence of operations is

(1,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,0)

which yields A = (21, 18, 24, 20), achieving max{A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4}-min{A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4} = 6.

An optimal sequence of operations is

(1,5), (1,5), (2,5), (2,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,0), (4,3)

which yields A = (111,111,111,111), achieving max{A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4}-min{A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4} = 0.
