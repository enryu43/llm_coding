Problem Statement
You are given a sequence of length N, A = (A_1, …, A_N), consisting of 1 and -1.

Determine whether there is an integer sequence x = (x_1, …, x_N) that satisfies all of the following conditions, and print one such sequence if it exists.

|x_i| ≤10^12 for every i (1≤i≤N).
x is strictly increasing. That is, x_1 < ⋯< x_N.
∑_i=1^N A_ix_i = 0.


Constraints
1≤N≤2×10^5
A_i ∈{1, -1}


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N
A_1 …A_N


Output
If there is an integer sequence x that satisfies all of the conditions in question, print Yes; otherwise, print No. In case of Yes, print the elements of such an integer sequence x in the subsequent line, separated by spaces.

x_1 …x_N


If multiple integer sequences satisfy the conditions, you may print any of them.

Sample Input 1
5
-1 1 -1 -1 1


Sample Output 1
Yes
-3 -1 4 5 7


For this output, we have ∑_i=1^NA_ix_i= -(-3) + (-1) - 4 - 5 + 7 = 0.

Sample Input 2
1
-1


Sample Output 2
Yes
0


Sample Input 3
2
1 -1


Sample Output 3
No
