Problem Statement
You have N sets S_1, S_2, …, S_N.
Initially, for each i from 1 to N, set S_i contains only integer i (that is, S_i = {i}).

You are allowed to perform the following operation:

Choose any i with 1 ≤i ≤N-1.
Let U = S_i ∪S_i+1 ー the union of sets S_i and S_i+1.
Then, replace both S_i and S_i+1 with U.


You want to perform a finite number of operations above (maybe zero), to get a configuration, in which S_i = {L_i, L_i+1, …, R_i-1, R_i} for all i from 1 to N. Is it possible to reach this configuration? If it is possible, also find the smallest number of operations needed to reach it.

Constraints
1 ≤N ≤5·10^5
1 ≤L_i ≤R_i ≤N


Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N
L_1 R_1
L_2 R_2
⋮L_N R_N


Output
If it is possible to reach the required configuration, output the smallest number of operations needed to do it. Otherwise, output -1.

It can be proved that it's impossible to obtain the required configuration.

We can perform the following sequence of operations:

Choose i = 2, get S_1 = {1}, S_2 = {2, 3}, S_3 = {2, 3}, S_4 = {4}
Choose i = 1, get S_1 = {1, 2, 3}, S_2 = {1, 2, 3}, S_3 = {2, 3}, S_4 = {4}
Choose i = 3, get S_1 = {1, 2, 3}, S_2 = {1, 2, 3}, S_3 = {2, 3, 4}, S_4 = {2, 3, 4}
Choose i = 2, get S_1 = {1, 2, 3}, S_2 = {1, 2, 3, 4}, S_3 = {1, 2, 3, 4}, S_4 = {2, 3, 4}
