Problem Statement
For an undirected tree t, let us define a rational number f(t) as follows.

Let n be the number of vertices in t.
If n=1: Let f(t)=1.
If n ≥2:
For an edge e in t, we denote by t_x(e) and t_y(e) the two trees that result from deleting e from t (in arbitrary order).
Let f(t)=(∑_e ∈t f(t_x(e)) ×f(t_y(e)))/n.




You are given a tree T with N vertices numbered 1 to N.
The i-th edge connects Vertex A_i and Vertex B_i.

Find the value f(T) mod 998244353.
What is a rational number mod 998244353?


Under the Constraints of this problem, when the sought rational number is represented as P/Q, it can be proved that Q ≠0 998244353. Therefore, there is a unique integer R such that R ×Q ≡P 998244353, 0 ≤R < 998244353. Find this R.
