Problem Statement
We have a sequence of length N consisting of integers between 0 and M, inclusive: A=(A_1,A_2,…,A_N).

Snuke will perform the following operations 1 and 2 in order.

For each i such that A_i=0, independently choose a uniform random integer between 1 and M, inclusive, and replace A_i with that integer.
Sort A in ascending order.


Print the expected value of A_K after the two operations, modulo 998244353.

How to print a number modulo 998244353?
It can be proved that the sought expected value is always rational.  
Additionally, under the Constraints of this problem, when that value is represented as P/Q using two coprime integers P and Q, it can be proved that there is a unique integer R such that R ×Q ≡P998244353 and 0 ≤R 998244353. Print this R.


Constraints
1≤K ≤N ≤2000
1≤M ≤2000
0≤A_i ≤M
All values in the input are integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N M K
A_1 A_2 …A_N


Output
Print the expected value of A_K after the two operations, modulo 998244353.

In the operation 1, Snuke will replace A_2 with an integer between 1 and 5. Let x be this integer. 

If x=1 or 2, we will have A_2=2 after the two operations.
If x=3, we will have A_2=3 after the two operations.
If x=4 or 5, we will have A_2=4 after the two operations.


Thus, the expected value of A_2 is 2+2+3+4+4/5=3.
