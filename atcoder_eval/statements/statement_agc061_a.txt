Problem Statement
There is an array A_1, …, A_N, and initially A_i = i for all i. Define the following routine shuffle(L, R):

If R = L + 1, swap values of A_L and A_R and terminate.
Otherwise, run shuffle(L, R - 1) followed by shuffle(L + 1, R).

Suppose we run shuffle(1, N). Print the value of A_K after the routine finishes.
For each input file, solve T test cases.

Constraints

1 ≤T ≤1000
2 ≤N ≤10^18
1 ≤K ≤N


Input
The input is given from Standard Input
 in the following format:
T
case_1
case_2
⋮case_T

Each case is in the following format:
N K


Output
Print T lines. The i-th line should contain the answer for the i-th case.

For N=2, we do the following and get A=(2,1).

Run shuffle(1, 2), and swap A_1 and A_2.

For N=5, we do the following and get A=(2,4,1,5,3).
