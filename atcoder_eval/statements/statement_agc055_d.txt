Problem Statement
Let's call a string T of length 3N, containing exactly N letters A, N letters B, and N letters C, good, if it can be split into N (not necessarily contiguous) subsequences of length 3, so that the letters from each subsequence form ABC, BCA, or CAB.

You are given a string S of length 3N, consisting of characters A, B, C, and ?.
Count the number of ways to replace each ? with one of A, B, and C, so that the resulting string is good. As this number can be very large, output it modulo 998244353.

Constraints
1≤N ≤15.
S is a string of length 3N, consisting of A, B, C, and ?.

Sample Input 1
1
???


Sample Output 1
3


There are 3 good strings you can obtain: ABC, BCA, and CAB.

Sample Input 2
2
AA????


Sample Output 2
2


There are 2 good strings you can obtain: AABBCC and AABCBC.

Sample Input 3
3
?A?A?A?A?


Sample Output 3
0


It's impossible to obtain a good string, as there are already 4 A's.

Sample Input 4
9
?????????A??B??C???????????
