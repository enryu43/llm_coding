Problem Statement
You are given a length-N sequence (A_1, A_2, …, A_N) of positive integers, and Q queries about the sequence.

For each q = 1, 2, …, Q, the q-th query gives you an integer pair (l_q, r_q);

print the number of integer triplets (i, j, k) such that

l_q ≤i j k ≤r_q, and
A_i = A_j = A_k.


Constraints
1 ≤N ≤2 ×10^5
1 ≤Q ≤2 ×10^5
1 ≤A_i ≤2 ×10^5
1 ≤l_q ≤r_q ≤N
All values in the input are integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N Q
A_1 A_2 …A_N
l_1 r_1
l_2 r_2
⋮l_Q r_Q


Output
Print Q lines.
For q = 1, 2, …, Q, the q-th line should contain the answer to the q-th query.

For the first query, there are five triplets of integers that satisfy the conditions in the problem statement:
(1, 5, 9), (4, 6, 8), (4, 6, 10), (4, 8, 10), and (6, 8, 10).
