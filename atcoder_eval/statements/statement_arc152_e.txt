Problem Statement
On a number line, there are 2^N-1 balls at the coordinates x=1,2,3,...,2^N-1, and the ball at x=i has a weight of w_i. Here, w_1, w_2,...,w_2^N-1 is a permutation of the integers from 1 through 2^N-1. You will choose a non-negative integer Z at most 2^N-1 and attach a weight of Z at each of the coordinates x=±100^100^100.
Then, the balls will simultaneously start moving as follows.

At each time, let R be the total XOR of the weights of the balls and attached weights that are strictly to the right of the coordinate of a ball, and L be the total XOR of the weights of the balls and attached weights that are strictly to the left. If R>L, the ball moves to the right at a speed of 1 per second; if L>R, the ball moves to the left at a speed of 1 per second; if L=R, the ball stands still.
If multiple balls exist at the same coordinate (when, for instance, two balls coming from the left and right reach there), the balls combine into one whose weight is the total XOR of their former weights.


For how many values of Z will all balls come to rest within 100^100 seconds?


        What is XOR?
    


        The bitwise XOR of non-negative integers A and B, A ⊕B, is defined as follows.
        
When A ⊕B is written in binary, the k-th lowest bit (k ≥0) is 1 if exactly one of the k-th lowest bits of A and B is 1, and 0 otherwise.

        For instance, 3 ⊕5 = 6 (in binary: 011 ⊕101 = 110).
  
        Generally, the bitwise XOR of k non-negative integers p_1, p_2, p_3, …, p_k is defined as (…((p_1 ⊕p_2) ⊕p_3) ⊕…⊕p_k), which can be proved to be independent of the order of p_1, p_2, p_3, …, p_k.

Let us call a ball with a weight of i simply i.

If Z=0, for instance, 1 and 2 first move to the right, and 3 moves to the left.
Then, the moment 2 and 3 collide and combine into one ball, it starts moving to the left.
Afterward, the moment all balls from 1 to 3 combine into one ball, it stands still.
Thus, Z=0 satisfies the condition.

On the other hand, if Z=3, then 1 and 2 keep moving to the left, and 3 keeps moving to the right, toward the attached weights for approximately 100^100^100 seconds.
Thus, Z=3 does not satisfy the condition.

It turns out that Z=0 is the only value that satisfies the condition, so you should print 1.
