Problem Statement
We have N oranges, numbered 1 through N.
The weight of Orange i is W_i.
Takahashi and Aoki will share these oranges as follows.



Choose a permutation (p_1, p_2, ⋯, p_N) of (1,2,⋯,N).



For each i = 1, 2, ⋯, N in this order, do the following.

If the total weight of the oranges Takahashi has taken is not greater than that of the oranges Aoki has taken, Takahashi takes Orange p_i.
Otherwise, Aoki takes Orange p_i.




Find the number of permutations p modulo 998244353 such that the total weight of the oranges Takahashi will take is equal to that of the oranges Aoki will take.

There are four permutations p satisfying the condition: (1,3,2),(2,3,1),(3,1,2),(3,2,1).
If p=(3,2,1), for example, the following will happen.

i=1: the total weights of the oranges Takahashi and Aoki have taken are 0 and 0, respectively. Takahashi takes Orange p_i=3.
i=2: the total weights of the oranges Takahashi and Aoki have taken are 2 and 0, respectively. Aoki takes Orange p_i=2.
i=3: the total weights of the oranges Takahashi and Aoki have taken are 2 and 1, respectively. Aoki takes Orange p_i=1.


Thus, the permutation p=(3,2,1) counts.
