Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer N and a sequence A = (A_0, A_1, …, A_2^N-1) of 2^N terms, where each A_i is an integer between 0 and 2^N-1 (inclusive) and A_i≠A_j holds if i≠j.
You can perform the following two kinds of operations on A:

Operation +: For every i, change A_i to (A_i + 1) 2^N.
Operation ⊕: Choose an integer x between 0 and 2^N-1. For every i, change A_i to A_i⊕x.

Here, ⊕denotes bitwise XOR.


        What is bitwise XOR?
    

        The bitwise XOR of non-negative integers A and B, A ⊕B, is defined as follows:
        
When A ⊕B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k ≥0) is 1 if exactly one of A and B is 1, and 0 otherwise.

        For example, we have 3 ⊕5 = 6 (in base two: 011 ⊕101 = 110).
    


Your objective is to make A_i = i for every i. Determine whether it is achievable. It can be proved that, under the Constraints
 of this problem, one can achieve the objective with at most 10^6 operations if it is achievable at all. Print such a sequence of operations.

Constraints

1≤N≤18
0≤A_i ≤2^N - 1
A_i≠A_j, if i≠j


Input
Input
 is given from Standard Input
 in the following format:
N
A_0 A_1 …A_2^N - 1


Output
If it is possible to make A_i = i for every i, print Yes; otherwise, print No.
In the case of Yes, it should be followed by a sequence of operations that achieves the objective, in the following format:
K
x_1 x_2 …x_K

Here, K is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, which must satisfy 0≤K≤10^6; x_i is an integer representing the i-th operation, which should be set as follows.

If the i-th operation is Operation +, x_i=-1.
If the i-th operation is Operation ⊕, x_i should be the integer chosen in that operation.

If there are multiple possible solutions, you may print any of them.

Sample Input

 13
5 0 3 6 1 4 7 2


Sample Output

 1Yes
4
-1 6 -1 1

The sequence of operations above changes the sequence A as follows.

Initially: A = (5,0,3,6,1,4,7,2)
Operation +: A = (6,1,4,7,2,5,0,3)
Operation ⊕(x = 6)：A = (0,7,2,1,4,3,6,5)
Operation +: A = (1,0,3,2,5,4,7,6)
Operation ⊕(x = 1)：A = (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)


Sample Input

 23
2 5 4 3 6 1 0 7


Sample Output

 2No

No sequence of operations achieves the objective.

Sample Input

 33
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7


Sample Output

 3Yes
0


Performing zero operations achieves the objective. Whether an empty line is printed or not does not affect the verdict.
