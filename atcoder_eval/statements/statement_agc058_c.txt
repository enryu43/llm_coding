Problem Statement
There are N vertices on a circumference.
The vertices are numbered 1 to N in clockwise order, and Vertex i has an integer A_i written on it, where A_i is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Here, A contains each of 1, 2, 3, and 4 at least once.
Consider making a tree by adding N-1 edges connecting these N vertices.
Here, the following conditions must be satisfied.


If Vertices x and y are directly connected by an edge, |A_x-A_y|=1.


When the edges are drawn as segments, no two of them intersect except at an endpoint.


For instance, the figure below shows a tree that satisfies the conditions:

Determine whether it is possible to construct a tree that satisfies the conditions.
Solve T test cases for each input file.

Constraints

1 ≤T ≤75000
4 ≤N ≤300000
1 ≤A_i ≤4
A contains each of 1, 2, 3, and 4 at least once.
The sum of N in one input file does not exceed 300000.
All values in input are integers.
