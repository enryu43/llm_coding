Problem Statement
Find the maximum side length of a regular triangle that can be drawn within a rectangle whose side lengths are A and B.

Constraints
1 ≤A,B ≤1000
A and B are integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

A B


Output
Print the answer.

Your output is considered correct if the absolute or relative error from the true answer is at most 10^-9.

Sample Input 1
1 1


Sample Output 1
1.03527618041008295791


The following figure shows an optimal drawing, with the side length of √(6) - √(2).



Note that the sample output does not strictly match √(6)- √(2), but the error is within 10^-9, so it is considered correct.
