Problem Statement
You are given N-digit positive integers A and B whose topmost digits are not 0.

You can repeat the following operation any number of times (possibly zero).

Choose an integer i such that 1 ≤i ≤N and swap the i-th lowest digits of A and B.


Find the smallest possible value of A ×B after your operations, modulo 998244353.

Note that you are not asked to minimize the remainder when A ×B is divided by 998244353.

Constraints
1 ≤N ≤200000
A and B are N-digit positive integers whose topmost digits are not 0.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N
A
B


Output
Print a single line containing the answer.

Sample Input 1
2
13
22


Sample Output 1
276


You can make A ×B = 276 by performing the operation once, as follows.

Choose i=1 to swap the bottommost digits of A and B, making A=12, B=23.


You cannot make A ×B = 275 or less, so the answer is 276.

Sample Input 2

21002300


Sample Output 2
54558365


Find the value modulo 998244353.
