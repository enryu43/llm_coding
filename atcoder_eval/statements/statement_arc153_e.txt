Problem Statement
For a positive integer X none of whose digits is 0, consider obtaining a positive integer Y as follows.

Initialize S as an empty string.
Let N be the number of digits in X. For i = 1, …, N in this order, do the following: insert the i-th character in the decimal notation of X at the beginning or end of S.
Let Y be the positive integer represented by the string S.


Let f(X) denote the minimum positive integer that can be obtained from X in this way.


You are given a positive integer Y none of whose digits is 0. Print the number, modulo 998244353, of positive integers X none of whose digits is 0 such that f(X) = Y.

Constraints
