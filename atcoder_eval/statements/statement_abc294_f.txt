Problem Statement
Takahashi and Aoki have N and M bottles of sugar water, respectively.
Takahashi's i-th sugar water is composed of A_i grams of sugar and B_i grams of water.
Aoki's i-th sugar water is composed of C_i grams of sugar and D_i grams of water.
There are NM ways to choose one from Takahashi's sugar waters and one from Aoki's and mix them. Among the NM sugar waters that can be obtained in this way, find the concentration of sugar in the sugar water with the K-th highest concentration of sugar.
Here, the concentration of sugar in sugar water composed of x grams of sugar and y grams of water is 100xx+y percent. We will ignore saturation.

Constraints

1 ≤N, M ≤5 ×10^4
1 ≤K ≤N ×M
1 ≤A_i, B_i, C_i, D_i ≤10^5
All values in the input are integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input
 in the following format:
N M K
A_1 B_1
A_2 B_2
⋮A_N B_N
C_1 D_1
C_2 D_2
⋮C_M D_M


Output
Print the concentration of sugar in the sugar water with the K-th highest concentration of sugar in percent.
Your output will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error from the true value is at most 10^−9.

Let (i, j) denote the sugar water obtained by mixing Takahashi's i-th sugar water and Aoki's j-th.
Below are the sugar waters that can be obtained and their concentrations of sugar.

(1, 1) : 100 ×1 + 1/(1 + 1) + (2 + 4) = 25 %
(2, 1) : 100 ×1 + 4/(4 + 1) + (1 + 4) = 50 %
(3, 1) : 100 ×1 + 1/(1 + 1) + (4 + 4) = 20 %

Among them, the sugar water with the highest concentration of sugar is (2, 1), with a concentration of 50 percent.
