Problem Statement
We have a grid A with N rows and M columns. Initially, 0 is written on every square.

Let us perform the following operation.

For each integer i such that 1 ≤i ≤N, in the i-th row, turn the digits in zero or more leftmost squares into 1.
For each integer j such that 1 ≤j ≤M, in the j-th column, turn the digits in zero or more topmost squares into 1.


Let S be the set of grids that can be obtained in this way.

You are given a grid X with N rows and M columns consisting of 0, 1, and ?.

There are 2^q grids that can be obtained by replacing each ? with 0 or 1, where q is the number of ? in X. How many of them are in S?

This count can be enormous, so find it modulo 998244353.

Constraints
N and M are integers.
1 ≤N,M ≤18
X is a grid with N rows and M columns consisting of 0, 1, and ?.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N M
X_1,1 X_1,2 …X_1,M
X_2,1 X_2,2 …X_2,M
⋮X_N,1 X_N,2 …X_N,M


Output
Print an integer representing the answer.
