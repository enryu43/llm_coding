Problem Statement
There are positive integers N, M, and an N ×M positive integer matrix A_i, j. For two (strictly) increasing positive integer sequences X = (X_1, …, X_N) and Y = (Y_1, …, Y_M), we define the penalty D(X, Y) as max_1 ≤i ≤N, 1 ≤j ≤M |X_i Y_j - A_i, j|.
Find two (strictly) increasing positive integer sequences X and Y such that D(X, Y) is the smallest possible.

Constraints

1 ≤N, M ≤5
1 ≤A_i, j ≤10^9 (1 ≤i ≤N, 1 ≤j ≤M)
All values in the input are integers. 


Input
Input
 is given from Standard Input
 in the following format:
N M
A_1,1 …A_1,M
⋮A_N,1 …A_N,M


Output
Output
 your answer in the following format:
D_min
X_1 …X_N
Y_1 …Y_M

Here, D_min is the smallest possible penalty and the following conditions should be satisfied:

D(X, Y) should be equal to D_min.
X_i < X_i + 1 (1 ≤i ≤N - 1).
Y_j < Y_j + 1 (1 ≤j ≤M - 1).
1 ≤X_i ≤2·10^9 (1 ≤i ≤N).
1 ≤Y_j ≤2·10^9 (1 ≤j ≤M).

One can show that there is an optimal solution satisfying the last two conditions.
