Problem Statement
You are given a permutation P=(P_1,P_2,⋯,P_N) of (1,2,⋯,N).
You may perform the following operation zero or more times.

Choose an integer i (1 ≤i ≤N-1).
Let v=max(P_i,P_i+1) and replace the values of P_i and P_i+1 with v.

How many sequences are there that P can be after your operations? Find the count modulo 998244353.
