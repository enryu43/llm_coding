Problem Statement
Given N, pos, val, find the number of permutations P=(P_1, P_2, …, P_N) of (1,2,…,N) that satisfy all of the following conditions, modulo 10^9+7:

LIS(P) + LDS(P) = N+1
P_pos = val


Here, LIS(P) denotes the length of the longest increasing subsequence of P, and LDS(P) denotes the length of the longest decreasing subsequence of P.

Constraints
1 ≤N ≤5·10^6
1 ≤pos, val ≤N
All values in the input are integers.
