Problem Statement
You are given positive integers S and K. A sequence of positive integers A = (A_1, A_2, …, A_N) is said to be a good sequence when satisfying the following two conditions.

1≤A_1 < A_2 < ⋯< A_N ≤S - 1 holds.
∑_i=1^NA_ix_i≠S holds for any sequence of non-negative integers (x_1, x_2, …, x_N).


Let A = (A_1, A_2, …, A_N) be the lexicographically smallest of the good sequences with the maximum number N of terms. Print the K-th term A_K of this sequence, or -1 if K > N.

We will give you T test cases; solve each of them.

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
3≤S≤10^18
1≤K ≤S - 1

For the cases S = 3, 7, 10, the sequence A will be as follows.

For S=3: A = (2).
For S=7: A = (2,4,6).
For S=10: A = (3,6,8,9).
