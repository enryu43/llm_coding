Problem Statement
You are given a sequence of N non-negative integers: D=(D_1, D_2, …, D_N).
Find the number of labeled trees with N vertices numbered 1 to N that satisfy the following condition, modulo 998244353.

There is a way to direct the N-1 edges so that the outdegree of each vertex i (1≤i ≤N) is D_i.


Constraints

2 ≤N ≤2 ×10^5
0 ≤D_i ≤N-1
∑_i=1^N D_i = N-1
