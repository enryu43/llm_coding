Problem Statement
A teacher has a hidden permutation P=(P_1,P_2,…,P_N) of (1,2,⋯,N).
You are going to determine it.
To do this, you prepared a sequence of pairs of integers (A_1,B_1),(A_2,B_2),…,(A_N(N-1)/2,B_N(N-1)/2); this is a permutation of all pairs of the form (a,b) (1 ≤a < b ≤N).
Now, you will go over the pairs from the beginning. For a pair (A_i, B_i), you will ask if P_A_i<P_B_i, and the teacher will tell you the answer.
However, you will skip this question if you can already determine the answer to it from previous answers.
Find the number of permutations P, for which with your algorithm you will have to ask all N(N-1)/2 questions, modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints

2 ≤N ≤400
1 ≤A_i < B_i ≤N
(A_i,B_i) ≠(A_j,B_j) (i ≠j)
All values in the input are integers.

Clearly, for any permutation P, you need to ask 1 question.

Consider P=(2,3,1,4) as an example.
In this case, you will skip the third question since you know P_1 < P_2 and P_1 > P_3 from previous questions and you can determine P_2 > P_3.
Therefore, P=(2,3,1,4) should not be counted.
