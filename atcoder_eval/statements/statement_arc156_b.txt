Problem Statement
For a finite multiset S of non-negative integers, let us define mex(S) as the smallest non-negative integer not in S. For instance, mex({0,0, 1,3}) = 2, mex({1 }) = 0, mex({}) = 0.
There are N non-negative integers on a blackboard. The i-th integer is A_i.
You will perform the following operation exactly K times.

Choose zero or more integers on the blackboard. Let S be the multiset of chosen integers, and write mex(S) on the blackboard once.

How many multisets can be the multiset of integers on the final blackboard? Find this count modulo 998244353.

Constraints

1 ≤N,K ≤2×10^5
0≤A_i≤2×10^5
All numbers in the input are integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input
 in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 …A_N


Output
Print the answer.

Sample Input

 13 1
0 1 3


Sample Output

 13

The following three multisets can be obtained by the operations.

{0,0,1,3 }{0,1,1,3}{0,1,2,3 }

For instance, you can get {0,1,1,3}by choosing the 0 on the blackboard to let S={0}in the operation.

Sample Input

 22 1
0 0


Sample Output

 22

The following two multisets can be obtained by the operations.

{0,0,0 }{0,0,1}

Note that you may choose zero integers in the operation.
