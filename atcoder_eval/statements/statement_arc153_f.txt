Problem Statement
You are given a simple connected undirected graph G with N vertices and M edges. The vertices are numbered 1 to N, and the i-th edge connects vertices A_i and B_i.

Find the number of ways to paint each edge of G in color 1, 2, or 3 so that the following condition is satisfied, modulo 998244353.

There is a simple path in G that contains an edge in color 1, an edge in color 2, and an edge in color 3.


What is a simple path?
A simple path is a pair of a sequence of vertices (v_1, …, v_k+1) and a sequence of edges (e_1, …, e_k) that satisfies the following:

 i≠j v_i≠v_j;
 edge e_i connects vertices v_i and v_i+1.



Constraints
3 ≤N≤2×10^5
3 ≤M≤2×10^5
1 ≤A_i, B_i ≤N
The given graph is simple and connected.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N M
A_1 B_1
⋮A_M B_M


Output
Print the number of ways to paint each edge of G in color 1, 2, or 3 so that the condition in question is satisfied, modulo 998244353.
