Problem Statement
Find the number, modulo 998244353, of good sequences of length N whose elements are integers between 0 and M, inclusive, and whose sum is at most K.

Here, a length-N sequence X=(X_1,X_2,…,X_N) is said to be good if and only if there is a graph G that satisfies all of the following conditions.

G is a graph with N vertices numbered 1 to N without self-loops. (It may have multi-edges.)
For each i (1≤i ≤N), the degree of vertex i is X_i.
For each i (1≤i ≤N), no edge connects vertex i and vertex i+1. Here, vertex N+1 means vertex 1.


Constraints
4 ≤N ≤3000
0 ≤M ≤3000
0≤K ≤NM
