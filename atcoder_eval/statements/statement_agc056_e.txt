Problem Statement
There is a circumference of length N.
On this circumference, a point whose distance from a certain fixed point, measured in the clockwise direction, is x has the coordinate x.

For each integer i (0 ≤i ≤N-1), there is a mouse at coordinate i+0.5.

Snuke will throw a piece of cheese N-1 times.
More specifically, he repeats the following N-1 times.

Choose an integer y (0 ≤y ≤N-1) randomly, where y=i is chosen with probability A_i percent. This choice is made independently each time.
Then, throw cheese from the coordinate y. The cheese travels in the clockwise direction on the circumference. When the cheese meets a mouse, the following happens.
If the mouse has not eaten cheese:
It eats the cheese with probability 1/2. The cheese disappears.
It does nothing with probability 1/2.


If the mouse has already eaten cheese:
It does nothing.




The cheese keeps traveling on the circumference until eaten by some mouse.


After N-1 throws of cheese, there will be exactly one mouse that has never eaten cheese.
For each k=0,1,⋯,N-1, find the probability that the mouse at coordinate k+0.5 ends up not eating cheese, modulo 998244353.
How to represent a probability modulo 998244353


We can prove that each probability in question is always a rational number. Additionally, under the Constraints of this problem, when that number is represented as an irreducible fraction P/Q, we can also prove that Q ≠0 998244353. Thus, there is a unique integer R such that R ×Q ≡P 998244353, 0 ≤R < 998244353. Answer with this R.

y=1 is always chosen. When throwing cheese from this point, the following happens.

With probability 1/2, the mouse at coordinate 1.5 eats it.
With probability 1/4, the mouse at coordinate 0.5 eats it.
With probability 1/8, the mouse at coordinate 1.5 eats it.
With probability 1/16, the mouse at coordinate 0.5 eats it.
⋮


In the end, the mice at coordinates 0.5 and 1.5 eat this cheese with probabilities 1/3 and 2/3, respectively.

Therefore, they end up not eating cheese with probabilities 2/3 and 1/3, respectively.
