Problem Statement
There are N customers named 1,…,N visiting a shop. Customer i arrives at time A_i and leaves at time B_i. The queue order is first in-first out, so A_i are increasing, and B_i are increasing. Additionally, all A_i and B_i are pairwise distinct.
At the entrance there's a list of visitors to put their names in. Each customer will write down their name next in the list exactly once, either when they arrive or when they leave. How many different orders of names can there be in the end?
Find the count modulo 998 244 353.

Constraints

1 ≤N ≤5 ·10^5
1 ≤A_i < B_i ≤2N
A_i < A_i + 1 (1 ≤i ≤N - 1)
B_i < B_i + 1 (1 ≤i ≤N - 1)
A_i ≠B_j (i ≠j)
