Problem Statement
You are given integers N and K.

Let's call an integer array a=[a_1, a_2, …, a_K] of length K good, if 1 ≤a_i ≤i for all 1 ≤i ≤K.

Let's call an integer array b=[b_1, b_2, …, b_NK] of length NK amazing, if it can be split into N (not necessarily contiguous) subsequences of length K, each of which is good.

Let's define f(pos, val) as the number of amazing sequences b such that b_pos=val.

Find f(pos, val) for all 1≤pos ≤NK, 1 ≤val ≤K.
As these numbers can be very big, output them modulo some prime P.

Constraints
1 ≤N ≤20.
1 ≤K ≤20.
10^8 ≤P ≤10^9
P is a prime.


Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N K P


Output
Output NK lines.
The j-th number in the i-th line should be equal to (f(i, j) P).
