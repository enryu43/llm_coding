Problem Statement
Consider making a string s of length N consisting of 0 and 1, where s must satisfy M conditions.
The i-th condition is represented by integers L_i and R_i (1 ≤L_i < R_i ≤N).
This means that there should be equal numbers of 0 and 1 between the L_i-th and R_i-th characters (inclusive) of s.

Find the lexicographically smallest string s that satisfies all conditions.
It can be proved that the Constraints of the problem guarantee the existence of s that satisfies the conditions.

Constraints
2 ≤N ≤10^6
1 ≤M ≤200000
1 ≤L_i < R_i ≤N
(R_i-L_i+1) ≡0 2
(L_i,R_i) ≠(L_j,R_j) (i ≠j)
All values in input are integers.
