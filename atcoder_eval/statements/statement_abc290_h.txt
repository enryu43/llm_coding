Problem Statement
There are N dogs numbered 1 through N and M cats numbered 1 through M.
You will arrange the (N+M) animals in a line from left to right.
An arrangement causes each animal's frustration as follows:

The frustration of dog i is A_i×|x-y|, where x and y are the numbers of cats to the left and right of that dog, respectively.
The frustration of cat i is B_i×|x-y|, where x and y are the numbers of dogs to the left and right of that cat, respectively.


Find the minimum possible sum of the frustrations.

Constraints
1≤N,M ≤300
1≤A_i,B_i ≤10^9
All values in the input are integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N M
A_1 A_2 …A_N
B_1 B_2 …B_M


Output
Print the answer as an integer.

Sample Input 1
2 2
1 3
2 4


Sample Output 1
6


Consider the following arrangement: dog 1, cat 2, dog 2, cat 1, from left to right.  Then,

dog 1's frustration is 1×|0-2|=2;
dog 2's frustration is 3×|1-1|=0;
cat 1's frustration is 2×|2-0|=4; and
cat 2's frustration is 4×|1-1|=0,


so the sum of the frustrations is 6.  Rearranging the animals does not make the sum less than 6, so the answer is 6.
