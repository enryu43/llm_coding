Problem Statement
There are three indistinguishable stones at integer coordinates on a number line. Consider the following operation on these stones:

Let A, B, C be the three stones in ascending order of coordinate (ties broken arbitrarily). Perform one of the following.
Move A to the symmetric position with respect to B.
Move C to the symmetric position with respect to B.




You are given the initial coordinates a, b, c of the three stones. Find the number, modulo 998244353, of possible combinations of coordinates of the three stones after zero or more operations.

Note that the stones are indistinguishable. More strictly speaking, count the possible multisets of coordinates of the three stones.

We will give you T test cases; solve each of them.

Constraints
1≤T≤10^5
-10^18≤a≤b≤c≤10^18

For (a,b,c) = (1,3,5), the five possible combinations of the three stones after operations are:

(1,3,5), (1,1,3), (-1,1,1), (3,5,5), (5,5,7).
