Problem Statement
You are given a string S of length N, consisting of A, B, and C.
You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose any i with 1 ≤i ≤N-2, such that S_iS_i+1S_i+2 is equal to ABC, BCA, or CAB.
Then, replace the three characters with ABC, BCA, or CAB.


For example, you can perform the following transformations with string AABC: 

AABC →ABCA →BCAA


Determine if you can obtain string T from string S with some finite (maybe zero) number of operations above.

Constraints
3≤N ≤5·10^5
S is a string of length N consisting of A, B, and C.
T is a string of length N consisting of A, B, and C.


Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N
S
T


Output
If you can transform S into T with the operations above, output YES, otherwise output NO.
The checker is case-insensitive: you can use either uppercase or lowercase letters.
