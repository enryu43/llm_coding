Problem Statement
You are given integers N and M.
Find the number of arrays A=[A_1, A_2, …, A_N] of length N such that the following conditions hold:

2 ≤A_i ≤M (1 ≤i ≤N)
There exists a permutation P=[P_1,P_2,…,P_N] of integers from 1 to N with the following property:
For every i from 1 to N, A_i equals the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the sequence [P_1, P_2, …, P_i-1, P_i+1, …, P_N-1, P_N].




As this number can be very large, output it modulo some prime Q.

Constraints
3 ≤N ≤5000.
2 ≤M ≤N-1.
10^8 ≤Q ≤10^9
Q is a prime.


Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N M Q


Output
Print the answer modulo Q.
