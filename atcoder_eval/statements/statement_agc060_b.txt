Problem Statement
We have a grid with N rows and M columns.
You want to write an integer between 0 and 2^K-1 in each square in the grid to satisfy the following condition.

Consider a path that starts at the top-left square, repeatedly moves right or down to an adjacent square, and ends at the bottom-right square.
Such a path is said to be good if and only if the total XOR of the integers written on the squares visited (including the starting and ending points) is 0.
There is exactly one good path, which is the path represented by a string S.
The path represented by the string S is a path that, for each i (1 ≤i ≤N+M-2), the i-th move is right if the i-th character of S is R and down if that character is D.


Determine whether there is a way to write integers that satisfies the condition.

For each input file, solve T test cases.


        What is bitwise XOR?
    


        The bitwise XOR of non-negative integers A and B, A ⊕B, is defined as follows.
        
When A ⊕B is written in binary, the k-th lowest bit (k ≥0) is 1 if exactly one of the k-th lowest bits of A and B is 1, and 0 otherwise.

        For instance, 3 ⊕5 = 6 (in binary: 011 ⊕101 = 110).
  
        Generally, the bitwise XOR of k non-negative integers p_1, p_2, p_3, …, p_k is defined as (…((p_1 ⊕p_2) ⊕p_3) ⊕…⊕p_k), which can be proved to be independent of the order of p_1, p_2, p_3, …, p_k.
