Problem Statement
For a sequence X=(X_1,X_2…,X_N) of length N consisting of positive integers, we define f(X) as follows:

A tree with N vertices is said to be good if and only if the degree of the i-th (1 ≤i ≤N) vertex is X_i.
If a good tree exists, f(X) is the maximum diameter of a good tree; if it doesn't, f(X)=0.


Here, the distance between two vertices is the minimum number of edges that must be traversed to travel from one vertex to the other,
and the diameter of a tree is the maximum distance between two vertices.

Find the sum, modulo 998244353, of f(X) over all possible sequences X of length N consisting of positive integers.
We can prove that the sum of f(X) is a finite value.

Given T test cases, find the answer for each of them.

If N=3,

for example,

when X=(1,1,1), there is no tree with three vertices whose degrees are 1,1, and 1, so f(X)=0.
When X=(2,1,1), the only possible tree is illustrated below.  The diameter of this tree is 2, so f(X)=2.









For X=(2,1,1),(1,2,1),(1,1,2), we have f(X)=2; for other X, we have f(X)=0.  Thus, the answer is 6.
