Problem Statement
Consider the following operations on an H×W matrix A = (A_i,j) (1≤i≤H, 1≤j≤W).

Row-sort: Sort every row in ascending order. That is, sort A_i,1,…,A_i,W in ascending order for every i.
Column-sort: Sort every column in ascending order. That is, sort A_1,j,…,A_H,j in ascending order for every j.


You are given an H×W matrix B = (B_i,j). Find the number of H×W matrices A that satisfy both of the following conditions, modulo 998244353.

Performing row-sort and then column-sort on A produces B.
Performing column-sort and then row-sort on A produces B.


Constraints
1≤H, W≤1500
0≤B_i,j≤9
B_i,j≤B_i,j+1, for any 1≤i≤H and 1≤j≤W - 1.
B_i,j≤B_i+1,j, for any 1≤j≤W and 1≤i≤H - 1.
All values in input are integers.


Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

H W
B_1,1 B_1,2 …B_1,W
⋮B_H,1 B_H,2 …B_H,W


Output
Print the number of matrices A that satisfy the conditions, modulo 998244353.

Sample Input 1
2 2
0 0
1 2


Sample Output 1
4


The four matrices that satisfy the conditions are:

[ 0 0; 1 2 ], [ 0 0; 2 1 ], [ 1 2; 0 0 ], [ 2 1; 0 0 ]. 

We can verify that [ 2 1; 0 0 ], for example, satisfies the conditions as follows.



Performing row-sort and then column-sort: [ 2 1; 0 0 ]→[ 1 2; 0 0 ] →[ 0 0; 1 2 ].



Performing column-sort and then row-sort:[ 2 1; 0 0 ]→[ 0 0; 2 1 ] →[ 0 0; 1 2 ].



Sample Input 2
3 3
0 1 3
2 4 7
5 6 8


Sample Output 2
576


[ 5 7 6; 3 0 1; 4 8 2 ], for example, satisfies the conditions, which can be verified as follows.



Performing row-sort and then column-sort: [ 5 7 6; 3 0 1; 4 8 2 ]→[ 5 6 7; 0 1 3; 2 4 8 ] →[ 0 1 3; 2 4 7; 5 6 8 ].



Performing column-sort and then row-sort: [ 5 7 6; 3 0 1; 4 8 2 ]→[ 3 0 1; 4 7 2; 5 8 6 ] →[ 0 1 3; 2 4 7; 5 6 8 ].
