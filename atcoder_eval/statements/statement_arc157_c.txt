Problem Statement
There is a grid with H rows and W columns where each square has one of the characters X and Y written on it.
Let (i, j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left.
The characters on the grid are given as H strings S_1, S_2, …, S_H: the j-th character of S_i is the character on square (i, j).
For a path P from square (1, 1) to square (H, W) obtained by repeatedly moving down or right to the adjacent square, the score is defined as follows.

Let str(P) be the string of length (H + W - 1) obtained by concatenating the characters on the squares visited by P in the order they are visited.
The score of P is the square of the number of pairs of consecutive Ys in str(P).

There are H + W - 2H - 1 such paths. Find the sum of the scores over all those paths, modulo 998244353.

What is NK?
NK is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose K from N distinct elements.


Constraints

1 ≤H ≤2000
1 ≤W ≤2000
S_i  (1 ≤i ≤H) is a string of length W consisting of X and Y.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input
 in the following format:
H W
S_1
S_2
⋮S_H


Output
Print the sum of the scores over all possible paths, modulo 998244353.

Sample Input

 12 2
YY
XY


Sample Output

 14

There are two possible paths P: (1, 1) →(1, 2) →(2, 2) and (1, 1) →(2, 1) →(2, 2).

For (1, 1) →(1, 2) →(2, 2), we have str(P) = YYY, with two pairs of consecutive Ys at positions 1, 2 and 2, 3, so the score is 2^2 = 4.
For (1, 1) →(2, 1) →(2, 2), we have str(P) = YXY, with no pairs of consecutive Ys , so the score is 0^2 = 0.

Thus, the sought sum is 4 + 0 = 4.

Sample Input

 22 2
XY
YY


Sample Output

 22

For either of the two possible paths P, we have str(P) = XYY, for a score of 1^2 = 1.
