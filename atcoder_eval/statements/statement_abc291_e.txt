Problem Statement
There is a length-N sequence A=(A_1,…,A_N) that is a permutation of 1,…,N.

While you do not know A, you know that A_X_i<A_Y_i for M pairs of integers (X_i,Y_i).

Can A be uniquely determined?  If it is possible, find A.

Constraints
2 ≤N ≤2×10^5
1 ≤M ≤2×10^5
1≤X_i,Y_i ≤N
All values in the input are integers.
There is an A consistent with the input.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N M
X_1 Y_1
⋮X_M Y_M


Output
If A can be uniquely determined, print Yes in the first line.  Then, print A_1,…,A_N in the second line, separated by spaces.

If A cannot be uniquely determined, just print No.

Sample Input 1
3 2
3 1
2 3


Sample Output 1
Yes
3 1 2


We can uniquely determine that A=(3,1,2).

Sample Input 2
3 2
3 1
3 2


Sample Output 2
No


Two sequences (2,3,1) and (3,2,1) can be A.

3 4
3 4


Sample Output 3
Yes
