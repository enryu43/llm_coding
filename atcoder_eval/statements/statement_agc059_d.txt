Problem Statement
For an integer array A=(A_1, A_2, …, A_N + K-1) (1 ≤A_i ≤N+K-1), let's construct an array B=(B_1, B_2, …, B_N), where B_i is the number of distinct elements in A_i,A_i+1,…,A_i+K-1.

You are given B_1, B_2, …, B_N. Determine if there exists an array A which could have produced such an array B, and if yes, construct one.

Solve T test cases for each input file.

Constraints
1 ≤T ≤5 ·10^4
2 ≤N ≤2 ·10^5
2 ≤K ≤2 ·10^5
1 ≤B_i ≤K
The sum of N in one input file doesn't exceed 2·10^5.
The sum of K in one input file doesn't exceed 2·10^5.
All values in the input are integers.


Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

T
case_1
case_2
⋮case_T


Each case is in the following format:

N K
B_1 B_2 …B_N


Output
For each test case, if such an array A doesn't exist, output NO.

Otherwise, output the answer in the following format:

YES
A_1 A_2 …A_N+K-1


Here, 1 ≤A_i ≤N+K-1 must hold, and A should produce B.
If multiple solutions exist, any of them will be accepted.

In printing YES or NO, you can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).
