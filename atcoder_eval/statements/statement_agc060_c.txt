Problem Statement
Consider a permutation P=(P_1,P_2,⋯,P_2^N-1) of (1,2,⋯,2^N-1).
P is said to be heaplike if and only if all of the following conditions are satisfied.

P_i < P_2i (1 ≤i ≤2^N-1-1)
P_i < P_2i+1 (1 ≤i ≤2^N-1-1)

You are given integers A and B.
Let U=2^A and V=2^B+1-1.
Find the probability, modulo 998244353, that P_U<P_V for a heaplike permutation chosen uniformly at random.
Definition of probability modulo 998244353
It can be proved that the sought probability is always rational. Additionally, under the constraints of this problem, when the sought rational number is represented as an irreducible fraction P/Q, it can be proved that Q ≠0 998244353. Therefore, there is a unique integer R such that R ×Q ≡P 998244353 and 0 ≤R 998244353. Print this R.
