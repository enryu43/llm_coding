Problem Statement
You are given integer sequences of length N: A=(A_1, A_2, …, A_N) and B=(B_1, B_2, …, B_N).
You may perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose an integer i (1 ≤i ≤N-2) such that A_i+A_i+1+A_i+2 is even. Then, rearrange A_i, A_i+1, A_i+2 as you like.

Determine whether it is possible to make A equal B.

Constraints

3 ≤N ≤2 ×10^5
1 ≤A_i, B_i ≤2 ×10^5
All values in the input are integers.


Input
The input is given from Standard Input
 in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 …A_N
B_1 B_2 …B_N


Output
If it is possible to make A equal B, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Sample Input

 15
1 2 3 4 5
3 1 2 4 5


Sample Output

 1Yes

A_1+A_2+A_3 is 1+2+3=6, which is even, so you can choose i=1.
If you choose i=1 and rearrange A_1, A_2, A_3 into A_3, A_1, A_2, then A becomes (3, 1, 2, 4, 5).
Now A equals B, so you should print Yes.
