Problem Statement
Given is a string S of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.

You can do the following operation on S any number of times.

Choose its (non-empty) contiguous substring such that the first character and the last character are different, and delete this substring.


Determine whether it is possible to make S empty. If it is possible, find the minimum number of operations needed to do so.

Constraints
2 ≤N ≤10^5
S is a string of length N consisting of lowercase English letters.


Input
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N
S


Output
If it is possible to make S empty, print the minimum number of operations needed to do so.
Otherwise, print -1.

Sample Input 1
4
abba


Sample Output 1
2


We should do as follows: abba → (delete ab) → ba → (delete ba) → an empty string.
