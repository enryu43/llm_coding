Problem Statement
Snuke received a permutation P=(P_1,P_2,⋯,P_N) of (1, 2, ... N) and an integer K.
He did some number of swaps of two adjacent elements in P so that the following condition would be satisfied.

For each 1 ≤i ≤N, there are at most K indices j such that 1 ≤j< i and P_j>P_i.


Here, he did the minimum number of swaps needed to achieve this condition.

Afterward, he has forgotten the original permutation he received.
Given the permutation P' after the swaps, find the number, modulo 998244353, of permutations that the original permutation P could be. 

Constraints
2 ≤N ≤5000
1 ≤K ≤N-1
1 ≤P'_i ≤N
P'_i ≠P'_j (i ≠j)
For each 1 ≤i ≤N, there is at most K indices j such that 1 ≤j< i and P'_j>P'_i.
All values in input are integers.

P could be one of the following two permutations.

P=(3,1,2): The minimum number of swaps needed is 0. After zero swaps, the permutation is equal to P'.
P=(3,2,1): The minimum number of swaps needed is 1: swapping P_2 and P_3 results in P=(3,1,2), which satisfies the condition and is equal to P'.
