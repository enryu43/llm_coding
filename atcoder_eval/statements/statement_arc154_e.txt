Problem Statement
For a permutation Q=(Q_1,Q_2,…,Q_N) of (1,2,…,N), let f(Q) be the following value:

the sum of j-i over all pairs of integers (i,j) such that 1 ≤i < j ≤N and Q_i > Q_j.


You are given a permutation P=(P_1,P_2,…,P_N) of (1,2,…,N).

Let us repeat the following operation M times.

Choose a pair of integers (i,j) such that 1 ≤i ≤j ≤N. Reverse P_i,P_i+1,…,P_j. Formally, replace the values of P_i,P_i+1,…,P_j with P_j,P_j-1,…,P_i simultaneously.


There are (N(N+1)/2)^M ways to repeat the operation. Assume that we have computed f(P) for all those ways.

Find the sum of these (N(N+1)/2)^M values, modulo 998244353. 

Constraints
1 ≤N,M ≤2 ×10^5
(P_1,P_2,…,P_N) is a permutation of (1,2,…,N).


Input
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N M
P_1 P_2 …P_N


Output
Print a single line containing the answer.

Sample Input 1
2 1
1 2


Sample Output 1
1


There are three ways to perform the operation, as follows.

Choose (i,j)=(1,1), making P=(1,2), where f(P)=0.
Choose (i,j)=(1,2), making P=(2,1), where f(P)=1.
Choose (i,j)=(2,2), making P=(1,2), where f(P)=0.


Thus, the answer is 0+1+0=1.
